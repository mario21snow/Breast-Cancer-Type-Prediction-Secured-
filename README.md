Prediction of Breast Cancer using Machine Learning Approaches

The proposed machine-learning approaches could predict breast cancer as the early detection of this disease could help slow down the progress of the disease and reduce the mortality rate through appropriate therapeutic interventions at the right time.

The main algorithms used to predict breast cancer using genetics were SVM, decision tree and random forest. However, imaging techniques used several algorithms such as CNNs and Na√Øve Bayes. On the other hand, the authors in [6] focused on gene mutation for detecting breast cancer

Machine learning helps with early diagnosis of breast cancer and determines the nature of the cancer by analysing the tumour size. Machine learning methods are the leading approaches to obtain favourable outcomes among classification and prediction problems.
